<h2>Creating A Virtual Machine Within Microsoft Azure</h2>

Once signed into your Microsoft Azure account, click on the top 3 lines, then click on virtual machines. Now, click Create and click Use Azure virtual machine. 
<h2>Setting Up Our Virtual Machine </h2>

Once you have clicked on Create Virtual Machine. Set your subscription to the account you used for your Azure Account. Then you want to make a resource group and name it anything you want. In this case, I named mine MyVMGroup. 
<h2>Setting up Instance Details </h2>

You then want to name your virtual machine. In this case, I have named mine Demo-VM. For the Region, you would choose the one that's closest to you. In this case, I chose West Europe. Leave all other settings in Instance details alone aside from Image. Here, you want to press the drop-down arrow and look for the option Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021- X64 Gen 2. If you need to, you can click on Run with Azure Spot Discount. 
<h2>Setting Up User Name and Password</h2>

After you do the following steps above. Click on size and find the one named Standard_D2s_v3 - 2 vcpus, 8 GiB memory. For user name and password, you can use whatever you like, but please make a note of them so you don't forget them. For my case, I used the user name jandoe. Please do not forget to press I confirm I have an eligible Windows 10/11 license with multi-tenant hosting rights. You can then press Review + Create, as you do not need to mess with any other settings. 
<h2>Creation of Our Virtual Machine </h2>

Once everything has been run and validated, you will get a screen that looks like this. You then want to press Create and wait for the VM to deploy so that it can be used.

Go to search, then look for the virtual we created. Then click on Primary NIC public IP and copy the Public IP address.

You want to click on yes after you get to this screen, after putting login info for the VM.

After you click no on everything, press next, and there you go, you have your very own VM.
